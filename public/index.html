//Built using ReactJS Library version 16.0.0
//
//I decided to use ReactJS for this assignment because I wanted to learn 
//it and get some hands on experience with it. A lot of Javascript development
//in the field is switching to React and I felt like I should learn it for
//a better start out in the job world. Along with becoming a new industry standard
//React is a very powerful library that make it easy to make some very powerful sites.
//React is also very friendly with other libraries and frameworks, It is all around useful.
//I use JQuery which I managed to get to work with ReactJS, it is not optimal to use JQuery in 
//ReactJS but since the assignment requires it I managed to get it working and JQuery Validation to
//work with ReactJS.

//ReactJS Library documentation: https://reactjs.org/docs/installation.html

//-------HOW TO COMPILE AND RUN-------
//To run this program it first needs to be built into a file that can be executed on a server or local machine.
//To start this navigate to the directory containing the src and public folder
//from there make sure you have NPM installed, directions to install it are here: http://blog.npmjs.org/post/85484771375/how-to-install-npm
//after npm is installed type in npm install to install the apps dependecies
//then npm run
//this will execute a development build on your local system. If you want to publish the app to a 
//web host instead of running npm start type in npm build and that will build a production version of the app.

//Bootstrap was used for styling in this application

      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.
